          <h2>Julia Evans</h2>
          <p>
            I am a software developer. I live in Montreal. I sometimes give
            talks. Most of my income comes from my programming zines business
            Wizard Zines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have one main opinion about programming, which is that deeply
            understanding the underlying systems you use (the browser, the
            kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database,
            HTTP, whatever you are running on top of) is essential if you want
            to do technically innovative work and be able to solve hard
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the fall of 2013 at the Recurse Center, which houses my
            favourite programming community. I wrote down what I did every day
            while there, if you want to know what it's like.

              showing how topics traditionally considered “hard” and “scary” are
              actually accessible and interesting and fun (TCP! / Kernel
              hacking! / Traceroute! / gzip! / databases! / SSL!)

              how being clear & curious & humble is better than sounding like I

              experimenting with alternative ways to teach hard concepts

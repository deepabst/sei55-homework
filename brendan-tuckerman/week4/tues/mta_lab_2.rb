# MTA Lab
# Activity:

#     Students should create a program that models a simple subway system.

#     The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints:
#         the stations the user must pass through, in order
#         where to change lines, if necessary
#         the total number of stops for the trip.

#     There are 3 subway lines:
#         The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
#         The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
#         The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
#         All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points.
#             For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.

# We should be able to say:

# plan_trip( :n, "Times Square", :l, "1st" )
# # Or something along those lines

require 'colorize' #for menu options
require 'pry' #for debugging

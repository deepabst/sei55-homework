// Take one argument, the guessed letter.
// Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
// If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
// When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__') and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
// It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed, and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.

// JavaScript Bank
// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.

// Bank
// There is only one bank. This bank is an object, which contains an array of accounts. The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.

// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.

// Accounts
// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or withdraw from an account to change the balance.

// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.

// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.

// Tips
// Don't overthink this. Shorter code is probably the answer.

// Bonus
// Ensure that the accounts cannot have negative values. DONE

// Write a 'transfer' on the bank that allows you to transfer amounts between two accounts.
//Legit xfer

bank.transferFunds(202, 101, 1000)  //expect "Insufficient funds"

// Credit Card Validation
// You're starting your own credit card business. You've come up with a new way to validate credit cards with a simple function called validateCreditCard that returns true or false.

// Here are the rules for a valid number:

// Number must be 16 digits, all of them must be numbers
// You must have at least two different digits represented (all of the digits cannot be the same)
// The final digit must be even
// The sum of all the digits must be greater than 16
// The following credit card numbers are valid:

// 9999-9999-8888-0000
// 6666-6666-6666-1666
// The following credit card numbers are invalid:

// a923-3211-9c01-1112 invalid characters
// 4444-4444-4444-4444 only one type of number
// 1111-1111-1111-1110 sum less than 16
// 6666-6666-6666-6661 odd final number
// Example
// validateCreditCard('9999-9999-8888-0000'); // Returns: true
// Hint: Remove the dashed from the input string before checking if the input credit card number is valid.

// Bonus: Return an object indicating whether the credit card is valid, and if not, what the error is

// { valid: true, number: 'a923-3211-9c01-1112' } 
// { valid: false, number: 'a923-3211-9c01-1112', error: ‘wrong_length’ }
// Double Bonus: Make your credit card scheme even more advanced! What are the rules, and what are some numbers that pass or fail? Ideas: check expiration date! Check out the Luhn Algorithm for inspiration.

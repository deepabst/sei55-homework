# MTA Lab

## How to use
- Run `ruby mta.rb` in terminal

## Features
- Show all lines and stops first
- Get inputs from terminal
- Check inputs valid or not


## Lines
- There are 3 subway lines:
  - The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
  - The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
  - The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
  - All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points.
    - For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.

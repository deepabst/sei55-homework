-- This file will create
-- 1. the structure of the 'albums' table
-- 2. several rows of 'seed'/test data to work with, i.e. several specific albums

-- By doing this in one file, we only need to run one sqlite3 command to 
-- re-initialise (restart) the whole database if we need to

-- This will nuke (remove) the albums table so we don't even have to
-- run 'rm database.db' before loading this albums.sql file
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS albums;

CREATE TABLE albums (

  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,  -- manage IDs for us; we won't have to specify them
  name TEXT,
  singer_id  INTEGER, 
  released TEXT,
  genre TEXT,
  length INTEGER,
  track_listing TEXT,
  image_url TEXT
       -- each pet knows who it belongs to
  -- we MUST name this field using the singular form of the other table name, plus '_id'
  -- This allows both albums to belong to an owner, AND an owner to have many albums

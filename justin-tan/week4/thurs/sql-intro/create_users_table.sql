-- This file defines the structure for creating a new table called "users"
-- It's also known as a "schema"


CREATE TABLE users (

    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, -- make sure the values in this column are unique
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    password TEXT, -- CAREFUL! We don't really store passwords as plain text
    profile_image TEXT,
    verified BOOLEAN,
    age INTEGER -- probably instead you would store a date of birth as a date field

    <h1>Edsger W. Dijkstra</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p id="bio">
    <strong>
    <p>  
    Edsger W. Dijkstra is considered one of the most influential researchers in mathematics and computing science. He developed much of his pioneering work at Mathematisch Centrum, the institute now named CWI. In honour of Dijkstra's work and legacy, CWI founded the Dijkstra Fellowships in 2019.</strong>
    </p> 
    <p>
    During his life he shaped the field of computer science like no other scientist. His ground-breaking contributions ranged from the engineering to the theoretical side of computer science. They covered areas such as compiler construction, operating systems, distributed systems, sequential and concurrent programming, software engineering, and graph algorithms. <br> Many of Dijkstra’s papers, often just a few pages long, are the source of new research areas. Indeed, several concepts that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and bear names coined by him.
    </p>  
    Dijkstra did not end up becoming a theoretical physicist, thanks to a discussion with Adriaan van Wijngaarden, at that time director of the Mathematisch Centrum’s Computation Department. After working as a programmer at the centre for three years, he knocked on Van Wijngaarden’s door, full of doubt, as he was finding it difficult to combine his role as a programmer and his study in theoretical physics at the Leiden University. ‘When I left his office hours later,’ Dijkstra said in his 1972 ACM Turing Lecture, ‘I was another person.’ Indeed, though programming was not an established discipline yet, Van Wijngaarden managed to convince Dijkstra that ‘it was here to stay’ and that he could play a part in putting the discipline on the map.
    <br>

    <strong>
    Cornerstone of fame: Dijkstra’s algorithm
    And put it on the map he did.</strong>
    <br>
    Dijkstra worked at the Mathematisch Centrum from 1952 to 1962, where he came up with what has become, in his words, ‘one of the cornerstones of my fame’. That cornerstone is the algorithm for the shortest path, also known as Dijkstra’s algorithm. According to Dijkstra, ‘it was a twenty-minute invention’ that he conceived while having a cup of coffee on a café terrace with his fiancée Ria, who he had met at Mathematisch Centrum. He initially used the algorithm in 1956 to showcase the potential of a new computer called ARMAC. But he understood all too well that a demonstration for laypeople had to have a problem and answer that they could understand.
    <br>
    His solution was to design an algorithm that would find the shortest route between two cities in the Netherlands using a simplified map. ‘What’s the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to Groningen?’ Dijkstra asked rhetorically in an interview with Communications of the ACM. ‘It is the algorithm for the shortest path.’ Though he used the algorithm for the official presentation of the ARMAC in 1956, it wasn’t published until 1959 in his three-page article A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs. Its impact is best summarised in 1999 by Danish computer scientist Mikkel Thorup: ‘Since 1959, all theoretical developments in SSSP [Single-Source Shortest Paths] for general directed and undirected graphs have been based on Dijkstra’s algorithm.’
    <br>
    <strong>ALGOL 60 programming</strong>
    Another key achievement during Dijkstra’s time at Mathematisch Centrum was his contribution to the development and popularisation of the programming language ALGOL 60. In 1958-1959, Dijkstra was involved in a number of meetings that culminated in the publication of the report defining the ALGOL 60 language. Ironically, Dijkstra’s name does not appear in the list of 13 authors of the final report: it seems he left the committee prematurely because he could not agree with the majority opinions. But it was during his tenure as a programmer at Mathematisch Centrum that he and his colleague Jaap Zonneveld wrote the first ALGOL 60 compiler, which among others used a new method for implementing recursion. His short book, A Primer of Algol 60 Programming, originally published in 1962, was the standard reference for the programming language for several years.
    <br>

    <strong>The birth of concurrent programming</strong>

    <br>
    In 1968, Dijkstra published his famous paper, Cooperating Sequential Processes, which provided the foundation for all subsequent designs of the operating systems and also gave birth to the field of concurrent programming. Many of Dijkstra’s ideas from this period had been germinating for some time. Indeed, Cooperating Sequential Processes had been completed in 1965 as manuscript, denoted by hem as EWD 123. Dijkstra consecutively numbered his largely handwritten manuscripts, using his Mont Blanc fountain pen, which are known in the world of computer science as EWDs. This paper proposes the first synchronisation mechanism for concurrent processes, the semaphore with its two operations, commonly known as P and V.

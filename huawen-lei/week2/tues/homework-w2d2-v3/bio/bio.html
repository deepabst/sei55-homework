        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <article>    
            
            <h3><b>Youth</b></h3>
            
            <p>
                Wiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, the first child of Leo Wiener and Bertha Kahn, Jewish immigrants from
                Lithuania and Germany, respectively. Through his father, he was related to Maimonides, the famous rabbi,
                philosopher and physician from Al Andalus, as well as to Akiva Eger, chief rabbi of Posen from 1815 to
                1837.[5] Leo had educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his own invention,
                except for a brief interlude when Norbert was 7 years of age. Earning his living teaching German and Slavic
                languages, Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited
                greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home. In
                his autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient, unless he (Norbert) failed to give a
                correct answer, at which his father would lose his temper.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A child prodigy, he graduated from Ayer High School in 1906 at 11 years of age, and Wiener then entered
                Tufts College. He was awarded a BA in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate
                studies of zoology at Harvard. In 1910 he transferred to Cornell to study philosophy. He graduated in 1911
                at 17 years of age.
            </p>

            <h3><b>Harvard and World War I</b></h3>
    
            <p>
                The next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard,
                Wiener became influenced by Edward Vermilye Huntington, whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic
                foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a Ph.D. in June 1913, when he was only 19 years
                old, for a dissertation on mathematical logic (a comparison of the work of Ernst Schröder with that of
                Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell), supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which
                were published as Wiener (1914). He was one of the youngest to achieve such a feat. In that dissertation, he
                was the first to state publicly that ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory. Hence
                relations can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or
                primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification
                of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is
                (x, y) = {{x}, {x, y}}.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                In 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by Bertrand Russell and G. H. Hardy at Cambridge
                University, and by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau at the University of Göttingen. At Göttingen he also
                attended three courses with Edmund Husserl "one on Kant's ethical writings, one on the principles of Ethics,
                and the seminary on Phenomenology." (Letter to Russell, c. June or July, 1914). During 1915–16, he taught
                philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for General Electric and wrote for the Encyclopedia Americana.
                Wiener was briefly a journalist for the Boston Herald, where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor
                conditions for mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance
                to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.                
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Although Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War
                I. In 1916, with America's entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential
                military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military,
                but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, Oswald Veblen invited
                Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.[7] Living and working with other
                mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform
                and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to
                his parents, "I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but
                unwilling to be a soldier."[8] This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by
                coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to
                Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.[9]
            </p>

            <h3><b>After the war</b></h3>

            <p>
                Wiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he attributed largely to anti-Semitism at the university and in particular the antipathy of Harvard mathematician G. D. Birkhoff.[10] He was also rejected for a position at the University of Melbourne. At W. F. Osgood's suggestion, Wiener was hired as an instructor of mathematics at MIT, where, after his promotion to professor, he spent the remainder of his career. For many years his photograph was prominently displayed in the Infinite Corridor and often used in giving directions, but as of 2017, it has been removed.[11]
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a Guggenheim scholar. He spent most of his time at Göttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on Brownian motion, the Fourier integral, Dirichlet's problem, harmonic analysis, and the Tauberian theorems.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1926, Wiener's parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance (1898–1973), married Philip Franklin. Their daughter, Janet, Wiener's niece, married Václav E. Beneš.[12] Norbert Wiener's sister, Bertha (1902–1995), married the botanist Carroll William Dodge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of Norbert Wiener at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness. It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day. He thanked her for the information and she replied, "That's why I stayed behind, Daddy!"
            </p>

            <p>
                In the run-up to World War II (1939–45) Wiener became a member of the China Aid Society and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars.[14] He was interested in placing scholars such as Yuk-Wing Lee and Antoni Zygmund who had lost their positions.

# Warmup: Leap Years 

Write a function that will take any given year and return a boolean value, whether it is a leap year or not. Remember that a leap year is:



* Every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
* Except if it is evenly divisible by 100...
* Unless it is also divisible by 400
* Test Data... Make sure it is working!

    
How to structure it - we want a custom function called isLeapYear which returns true or false.


``` 
isLeapYear(1997) // ==> false
isLeapYear(1996) // ==> true
isLeapYear(1900) // ==> false
isLeapYear(2000) // ==> true

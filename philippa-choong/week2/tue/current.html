                    For people who want to make sure the Web serves humanity, we have to concern ourselves with what people are building on top of it,” - Tim Berners-Lee

                    Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Foundation to protect the rights of web users.  In recent years, he has become increasingly concerned that national governments and the world’s largest Internet companies are making questionable use of users’ personal data.  He is developing a new Internet platform, Solid, to restore a sense of digital democracy and give all users the ability to restrict access to their own information and to whatever content they create on the web.  In 2018, it was estimated that four billion people, half the world’s population, would soon be online.  With a small team of coders, Sir Timothy Berners-Lee is developing Solid as an open-source platform, to decentralize control of the web and give billions of web users around the world control over their own data.
